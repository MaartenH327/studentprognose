# Student forecasting model

This Python script predicts the influx of students at the Radboud University for the current year and week. The year and week can also be specified.

# Quick Start  
After completing the **Prerequisites (short)**, you can start running the script right away. If you need more details, check out the **Prerequisites (longer)**.  

üìå Important: This script only works with the cumulative file and the model designed for it. The individual data file is internal (OSIRIS data) and will be explained later.  

üõ†Ô∏è **Ongoing Development:** This README is still being improved and will be updated as more people use it, ensuring it works optimally for everyone.  

#### üîπ Quick script execution:
```
uv run main.py -y 2024 -w 4
```
This runs a prediction for the academic year 2024/2025 in week 4.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
- Check the pseudonymized data to see which years and weeks are available. If no year and week are specified, the script defaults to the current week, which may not work with the provided data. 
- Ensure that configuration.json contains the correct file paths for the provided files; otherwise, the script will fail.
- You can use the **base.json** file to filter by program, exam type, or origin to quickly test whether the script works.

```

# Why an enrollment forecast?  

Every year, it's an exciting moment: How many students showed up at your classroom door in the first week of September? And what does the October 1st count look like for your entire institution? Well, exciting... we can actually predict this! The goal of the enrollment forecast is to predict, at an early stage, how many students will enroll in each program in the coming year.  

See a concrete example from the Artificial Intelligence program at Radboud University:  

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aff378c-74d7-4d97-86ed-00d28491a4b4" width="400">

*The green line represents the final number of enrollments in this program. The different models (purple and yellow lines) have been stable since March (week 14), with the yellow line even stable from the beginning.*  
</div>  

This gives an educational institution reliable insights into the final number of students months in advance. As a result, institutions can efficiently allocate schedules, staff, and scarce financial resources. Also, check out an [interview](https://www.voxweb.nl/nieuws/de-universiteit-heeft-nu-haar-eigen-glazen-bol-nieuw-model-voorspelt-toekomstige-instroom-van-studenten) with Amir about the model.

# Contributing to further development  

On October 29, 2024, Amir Khodaie and Timo Koster shared the [evaluations of their enrollment forecasts](https://community-data-ai.npuls.nl/groups/view/44d20066-53a8-48c2-b4e9-be348e05d273/project-center-for-educational-data-analytics-ceda/events/view/610c71bd-5859-4092-906c-58bbfdf9801c/instroomprognose-terugblik-en-vooruit-kijken). The session was recorded‚Äîif you would like to watch it back, please contact Corneel den Hartogh (corneel.denhartogh@surf.nl).  

Want to contribute ideas? Feel free to join the [working group](https://edu.nl/6d69d).  

Thanks to your previous feedback, we have improved the code and added documentation. We have also included a test file with pseudonymized data so you can test the functionality. Note: This is only for the cumulative model (see below).  

The next step was to create a script that transforms raw Studielink count files into the cumulative data format used by the model. This has now been completed, and the script is called **"rowbind_inputfiles.py"**.  

It is difficult to determine which institutions do or do not have a suitable file. We have assumed that institutions have one large Studielink count file that still needs to be transformed into the cumulative data file required by the model. This script performs that transformation.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Make sure to adjust the file path correctly so you can run the script properly. The script is located in the **standalone** folder.  

Additionally, we are working on a better description of the 'individual' file.  

To be continued!  

# Student forecasting model

This Python script predicts the influx of students at the Radboud University for the current year and week. The year and week can also be specified.

---
# Prerequisites (longer)

1. Install uv on your system:

Please refer to the official installation guide of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

2. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cedanl/studentprognose.git

cd studentprognose
```

---
# Usage of program
Execute the script with the current year and week using the following command:

```
uv run main.py
```

To predict different years/weeks or in a different way, use any of the following command line parameters to your liking.

## Years and weeks specification

Execute the script with a specified year and week with `-y` and `-w`, e.g.:

```
uv run main.py -w 6 -y 2024
uv run main.py -W 1 2 3 -Y 2024
uv run main.py -year 2023 2024
uv run main.py -week 40 41
```

For predicting multiple years/weeks we also provide slicing, in the example the weeks 10 up to and including 20 will be predicted:

```
uv run main.py -w 10 : 20 -y 2023
```

### Datasets (use only if you have multiple datasets, other than the Studielink data)

The main datasets that are used in this script are the cumulative data per programme/origin/year/week and individual data per student. If one of these is not present then only the other dataset can be used.

```
uv run main.py -d individual
uv run main.py -D cumulative
uv run main.py -dataset both
```

When there is no dataset specified, both datasets will be used.

## Configuration

The script has to have a configuration file for numerous different reasons. The path to the configuration is `configuration/configuration.json` by default, but can be changed in the terminal:

```
uv run main.py -c path/to/configuration.json
uv run main.py -configuration longer/path/to/config.json
```

## Filtering

The model requires a filtering file to specify the desired programme, origin, and exam type. By default, the file is located at `configuration/filtering/base.json`, but you can override this via the terminal:

```
uv run main.py -f path/to/filtering.json
uv run main.py -filtering longer/path/to/filtering.json
```

For example, if you want to predict the number of first-year 'Bachelor' students enrolled in the 'B Sociologie' programme, coming from either 'NL' or 'EER', your filtering file should look like this:

```
{
    "filtering": {
        "programme": [
            "B Sociologie"
        ],
        "herkomst": [
            "NL",
            "EER"
        ],
        "examentype": [
            "Bachelor"
        ]
    }
}
```
Simply update the default file (`configuration/filtering/base.json`) with your desired filters.

## Large example

Example 1: Predict first years of the years 2023 and 2024, weeks 10 up to and including 20 and use both datasets

```
uv run main.py -y 2023 2024 -w 10 : 20 -d b
```

Example 2: Predict first years students of the academic year 2025/2026, week 5, use cumulative, only postprocess new predicted data

```
uv run main.py -y 2025 -w 5 -d c
```

# Calculate student count

To generate files with aggregated student counts, simply run:
```
uv run scripts/standalone/calculate_student_count.py
```
This command processes all available data years, using Octoberdata to calculate total counts per croho/origin. These aggregated student counts are then utilized by various components of the application, including error analysis and higher-year student predictions.

# Calculate ensemble weights

To compute the weighted ensemble prediction, you first need to calculate ensemble weights based on past performance. To calculate ensemble weights for the current year, run:
```
uv run scripts/standalone/calculate_ensemble_weights.py
```
To specify a different year or multiple years, add the year argument(s):
```
uv run scripts/standalone/calculate_ensemble_weights.py -y 2023
uv run scripts/standalone/calculate_ensemble_weights.py -year 2023 2024
uv run scripts/standalone/calculate_ensemble_weights.py -y 2022 : 2024
```

# Appending studentcount and computing errors

When predicting the influx of students for a historical year, one for which the actual student count is already available, the model operates in a two-step process. Initially, it produces predictions without incorporating the known actual numbers. Once the prediction is complete, the system automatically appends the actual student counts to the output. This process enables the calculation of prediction errors by comparing the forecasted values with the true data.

For predictions of future years, the model only generates forecasts since the actual student numbers are not yet known. Later, when the actual data becomes available and you have updated the student count files accordingly, you can execute the following command:
```
uv run scripts/standalone/append_studentcount_and_compute_errors.py
```
Running this command will merge the newly available actual student counts with the previously generated forecasts, and it will compute the errors between the two sets of values. This systematic approach helps in validating the accuracy of the model and fine-tuning it for improved future predictions.

# Predicting higher-year students

The prediction for higher-year students is based on a linear model:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{nextyear\_higher\_years} & = \text{currentyear\_higher\_years}\\
                               & + (\text{currentyear\_first\_years} \times \text{ratio\_advancing\_to\_second\_year})\\
                               & - (\text{currentyear\_higher\_years} \times \text{ratio\_dropping\_out})
\end{aligned}
$$
The ratios are computed automatically using data from the three preceding years, drawing from both the Octoberdata and studentnumber datasets. For example, when predicting for 2024, the ratios are calculated using data from 2021, 2022, and 2023.

To run the prediction for the current year, execute:
```
uv run scripts/higher_years/higher_years.py
```

To specify a different year or multiple years, add the year argument(s):
```
uv run scripts/higher_years/higher_years.py -y 2023
uv run scripts/higher_years/higher_years.py -year 2023 2024
uv run scripts/higher_years/higher_years.py -y 2022 : 2024
```

<!-- ## Testing

There are currently 6 tests defined. A different test for both datasets, the cumulative dataset and the individual. For every dataset there is a fast and exhaustive test. The tests will automatically make sure that the right configuration is loaded. The tests can be ran by using the Makefile commands for simplicity.

Example: Running the exhaustive test for both datasets

```
make test-eb
```

Please look at the Makefile for the other commands. -->

# Pre-commit

Pre-commit hooks are essential tools for maintaining code quality and consistency. They run automatically before each commit, catching common issues early in the development process. By enforcing coding standards and style guides, pre-commit hooks ensure that the codebase is clean and consistent, making it easier to read, maintain, and collaborate on.

In this project, we use several pre-commit hooks to enhance code quality. The check-yaml hook checks for syntax errors in YAML files, preventing potential misconfigurations. The end-of-file-fixer ensures that files end with a newline character, meeting POSIX standards and avoiding file concatenation issues. The trailing-whitespace hook removes unnecessary whitespace, leading to cleaner commits. Finally, black automatically formats Python code, ensuring consistent style and readability.

These hooks are run automatically before every commit. When an error is detected, it will be 'repaired' automatically. Note that you have to stage and commit these changes again. Otherwise no commit was done.

Note: Committing via the terminal will reveal more information about the concerning pre-commit than committing via Github Desktop/VSCode Source Control.
